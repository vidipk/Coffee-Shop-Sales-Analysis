# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis

## Introduction

The "Coffee Shop Sales Analysis" project aims to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the coffee shop. By utilizing advanced Excel formulas and pivot tables, we can derive meaningful conclusions about sales patterns, peak times, best-selling products, and more.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:
1. Understand how sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day.
2. Identify peak sales times.
3. Calculate monthly sales revenue.
4. Compare sales across different store locations.
5. Determine the average price per order.
6. Identify best-selling products in terms of quantity and revenue.
7. Analyze sales variations by product category and type.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains detailed sales records from the coffee shop. The main attributes in the dataset include:
- `Date`: The date of the sale.
- `Time`: The time of the sale.
- `Location`: The store location where the sale occurred.
- `Product`: The product sold.
- `Category`: The category of the product.
- `Quantity`: The number of units sold.
- `Price`: The price of the product.
- `Revenue`: The total revenue generated from the sale.

## Methodology

### Data Import and Preparation
- Import the sales data into Excel.
- Ensure that the data is clean, with no missing or erroneous values.
- Convert date and time columns into appropriate Excel date and time formats for accurate analysis.

### Analysis

1. **Sales Variation by Day of the Week and Hour of the Day**:
   - Use pivot tables to summarize sales data by day of the week and hour of the day.
   - Create pivot charts to visualize the sales patterns.

2. **Identify Peak Sales Times**:
   - Analyze the pivot table data to determine peak sales hours and days.
   - Highlight peak times in the charts for easy reference.

3. **Calculate Monthly Sales Revenue**:
   - Use Excel formulas to extract month and year from the date column.
   - Create a pivot table to aggregate monthly sales revenue.
   - Generate a line chart to visualize the monthly sales trends.

4. **Compare Sales Across Different Store Locations**:
   - Use pivot tables to compare sales figures across different store locations.
   - Visualize the comparison using bar charts or column charts.

5. **Determine Average Price per Order**:
   - Calculate the average price per order using the formula: `Average Price = Total Revenue / Total Quantity`.
   - Use pivot tables to summarize the data and calculate the average price per order for each location.

6. **Identify Best-Selling Products (Quantity and Revenue)**:
   - Use pivot tables to identify the top-selling products based on quantity sold and revenue generated.
   - Visualize the top products using bar charts.

7. **Analyze Sales Variations by Product Category and Type**:
   - Create pivot tables to analyze sales by product category and type.
   - Use pivot charts to visualize the variations in sales across different categories and product types.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Primary tool for data import, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables**: For summarizing and analyzing data efficiently.
- **Advanced Excel Formulas**: For calculating metrics such as monthly revenue, average price per order, and extracting date/time components.
- **Pivot Charts**: For visualizing sales patterns, peak times, top products, and sales variations.

## Results and Insights

1. **Sales Patterns**:
   - Sales patterns by day of the week and hour of the day reveal peak sales times.
   - Identified that weekends have higher sales compared to weekdays.
   - Peak sales hours are typically in the morning and early afternoon.

2. **Monthly Sales Trends**:
   - Monthly sales revenue trends show seasonality, with certain months performing better.

3. **Store Location Performance**:
   - Comparison of sales across store locations identifies the top-performing and underperforming locations.

4. **Product Performance**:
   - Best-selling products and categories help in inventory management and marketing strategies.
   - Identified top products in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.

## Conclusion

The Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project provides valuable insights into sales patterns, peak times, product performance, and store location comparisons. By leveraging advanced Excel formulas and pivot tables, we can enhance decision-making processes and improve the overall performance of the coffee shop.
